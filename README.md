# Hubzilla Project Website

This repo contains the Hubzilla project webpage elements, which can be imported using the website import tool. After importing the elements, you can visit `https://your.hub/page/your_channel/hubzilla-project` to view the website. 

**The importing channel must have AllowCode permission**. Administrators set this permission on a per-channel basis at `/admin/channels`.

Due to a quirk in the import process, the presence of a `.git` folder in the uploaded zip file causes a failure, so for convenience the `hubzilla-website.zip` file has been created for you to upload directly.
